## In Plain Language

This study looks at how the relationships between company boards, known as *board interlocks*, and directors’ prior experience with sustainability affect how transparently firms disclose sustainability information.  
We show that when directors are linked to other boards that value sustainability, or when they themselves have relevant experience, their companies tend to be more open and comprehensive in their sustainability reporting.  
The findings highlight how social and experiential connections among boards can drive corporate transparency.

## Paper Highlights: 
| # | Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---------------|-------------------------|
| **1** | **Boards can import transparency know‑how.** Firms struggle to make sustainability reporting credible. | Evidence from **S&P 1500 (2009‑2018)** shows that boards with interlocked directors who have prior sustainability‑committee experience produce markedly more transparent disclosure.  |
| **2** | **Diversity of network ties > echo chambers.** Relying only on same‑industry peers risks group‑think. | A broader mix of **similar and dissimilar‑industry interlocks** is positively linked to transparency, confirming learning benefits from heterogeneous knowledge sources. |
| **3** | **Tap the ‘best reporters.’** Benchmarking leaders accelerates improvement. | Interlocks with firms known for *superior* transparency boost the focal firm’s disclosure quality. |
| **4** | **Experience isn’t enough—board design amplifies it.** Governance levers can multiply learning effects. | Sustainability experience interacts with **gender diversity and board independence** to further enhance transparency.  |
| **5** | **Rock‑solid evidence base.** Managers want confidence before reshaping boards. | Robustness checks—propensity score matching, fixed‑effects, and entropy balancing—consistently uphold all hypotheses.  |


## Managerial Takeaways
- **Recruit directors with proven sustainability‑committee experience from other boards** to import disclosure expertise and raise transparency standards. 
- **Cultivate a diverse web of board interlocks—across and beyond your industry**—to access fresh perspectives and innovative reporting practices. 
- **Forge connections with transparency leaders.** Interlocking with top‑reporting firms accelerates adoption of best‑practice frameworks and metrics. 
- **Pair sustainability experience with gender‑diverse and independent boards** for maximum oversight lift; the combination drives the biggest transparency gains. 
- **Use interlocks strategically in succession planning.** Prioritize candidates who bring external sustainability credentials when refreshing the board. 
- **Leverage interlocks as a resource pathway, not a box‑ticking exercise.** The study’s resource‑dependence lens shows transparent leaders share systems, not just signals.
