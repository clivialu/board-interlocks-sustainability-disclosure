## In plain language

This study looks at how the relationships between company boards, known as *board interlocks*, and directors’ prior experience with sustainability affect how transparently firms disclose sustainability information.  
We show that when directors are linked to other boards that value sustainability, or when they themselves have relevant experience, their companies tend to be more open and comprehensive in their sustainability reporting.  
The findings highlight how social and experiential connections among boards can drive corporate transparency.
